# group67RecipeApp

## Description of the problem domain:
This project revolves around food, nutrition, and recipes. Our project plans to address the common kitchen dilemma of deciding what to cook with the available ingredients on hand. We plan to solve this issue by giving users an easy way to get recipes based on individual preferences, nutritional values, and the ingredients they have at home.

## Description of application:
The application should provide the following functions:
* Search and suggest recipe ideas based on specific ingredients given by the user 
* Search and suggest recipe ideas based on specific diets that the user indicates
* Suggest a recipe based on your specified macro suggestions (i.e. between 10g - 30g of protein)
* Provide basic nutritional content about any recipe or ingredient
* Optional: keep track of ingredient usage and create a shopping list
